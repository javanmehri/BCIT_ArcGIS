# Joining data by attribute

In this exercise we will examine the Food Access Research Atlas, a study to identify "food deserts", which are low-income neighborhoods with high concentrations of people who are far from a grocery store. 

##### 1. To examine the results of the Food Desert Locator study, go to this link address:

Next, you will learn how to create a similar map using an ERS dataset, limiting the study area to the state of Wisconsin.

##### 5. Open the ex17a map document.
